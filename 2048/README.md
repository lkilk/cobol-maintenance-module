# 2048

In this directory is a game called 2048 drawn from the GnuCOBOL examples
repository.

Your tasks are to:

1. Amend the program to colour each number differently to aid in reading
   the board.
2. Amend the program to have a 6x6 grid, rather than a 4x4 grid.

To do this, you will benefit from spending some time diagramming the code
first and understanding how it works. Try to have a very clear idea of what
changes will be required throughout the program before you start working on
the changes.
